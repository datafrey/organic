Simple example of how I can create webpages using a layout.

Layout: [link](<https://www.figma.com/file/3fLxZpVMFut6n87AAX1VqH/Agriculture-Webflow-Website-Template-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1-430&t=KCTea85eNIU7Qwpf-0>).
<br>
Demo: [link](https://organicdatafrey.netlify.app/).

<br>

Technologies used:

- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Gulp with modules:
  - Division of .html files into blocks with importing only needed parts into each website page
  - Transformation of SCSS code into CSS code with a block-dividing and -importing feature
  - Babel incorporation
  - Images compression and transformation to .webp format with on-page loading optimization
  - Fonts compression to .woff and .woff2 formats with on-page loading optimization
- Tiny Slider

<br>

All webpages are responsive.

The `dist` folder is included into this repository to represent the final result of the work. It includes the production version of scripts, compressed and converted images and fonts.
